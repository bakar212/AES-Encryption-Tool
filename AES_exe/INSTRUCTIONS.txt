This file should include everything you require:
-the executable file is in the 'dist' folder named AES_Tool.exe which is a standalone application and doesn't require further actions.

However if you want to explore/run the source code a few steps must be undertaken...
-the python source code is in this file's directory named: AES_TOOL
-the python source code requires the 'numpy' package which can be installed via 
running CMD in adminstrator mode with the following command: 'pip install numpy'
-the 'os' package must also be imported into the python source code.
